# circle-drawing-training
Train to draw a perfect circle. Press mouse button or pen on a tablet to start drawing. You can try using a single stroke or a series of smaller strokes. Drawing is considered complete if mouse button is not pressed for at least 1sec. After 1sec, you can start drawing another circle. For each drawing, you will be shown its center, radius, and deviation from a perfect circle. Perfect circle will also be drawn in red. Circles with deviation will be drawn in blue.

Ideal circle has zero deviation, so, lower numbers are closer to the ideal.

You can also train to draw in a given proportion by looking at the radii, e.g. drawing a circle that is half the size of another one.
